Matthew: New to the city and commutes from the northside of the city to the loop for work. He hasn't made too many friends in the city yet so he needs to be able to find some good spots to go to that wont break the bank that are close to his work and on the weekends are in his own neighborhood. 
 
 
Veronica: A born and bred Chicagoan who usually only goes to chain restaurants and bars only because she doesn't know what local bars have to offer, she likes familiarity and knowing what she is going to be walking into when she visits an establishment. She has friends in different neighborhoods all around the city and often spends most of the evening browsing yelp to find the perfect bar to go unwind at after work. 
 
Enrique: A visitor to Chicago who has heard of a few good bars to go to based on recommendations from friends who have also visited the windy city but isn't quite sure where they are located.
